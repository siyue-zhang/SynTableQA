Question: how many plants have at least 1,500 employees?
Response A: 3
Response B: 2
Answer: to find the number of plants with more than 1500 people employees, we need to look at the employees column and count the entries that exceed 1500. 
1. st. louis assembly (1445<1500)
2. atlanta assembly (2028>1500)
3. batavia transmission (1745>1500)
4. windsor casting (684<1500)
5. total (5902>1500)
